            <h1>Fees and Charges</h1>

                <h2>Image Fees</h2>

                <p>For image engraving, we charge based on the square inch size of the image. Our rate is $1.10 per square inch, which allows us to capture even the most intricate details of your image and engrave it onto your selected item. This fee covers the setup and engraving process to ensure the highest quality and clarity in reproducing your image.</p>

                <h2>Vector Creation</h2>

                <p>When it comes to image manipulation for laser engraving or CNC routing, vectors are essential. Vectors are mathematical representations of shapes, allowing for precise scaling and editing without compromising the image quality. By converting images to vectors, we can ensure that the engravings are accurate, sharp, and maintain their integrity across different sizes and materials. The process of creating vectors involves <span class="strong">skilled graphic design work</span> and meticulous attention to detail to optimize the image for engraving.</p>
